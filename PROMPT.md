# Nx OpenTelemetry Weaver Plugin - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for developing an Nx plugin that integrates OpenTelemetry Weaver into Nx workspaces, providing transparent telemetry schema management and code generation for enterprise-scale development teams.

## Problem Statement

Development teams using Nx workspaces with OpenTelemetry Weaver currently face several challenges:
- Manual execution of Weaver commands for validation, policy checking, and code generation
- No standardized management of Weaver executable versions across projects
- Lack of type-safe configuration for Weaver operations
- Missing integration with Nx's build and caching systems
- Manual environment and argument management for Weaver operations

## Goals & Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Transparent Developer Experience**: Developers get metrics definitions generated automatically without manual intervention
2. **Enterprise Scale**: Support 1000+ engineers with consistent tooling and configuration
3. **Type Safety**: Provide TypeScript interfaces and compile-time validation for Weaver configurations and schema references
4. **Performance**: Integrate with Nx caching to minimize build impact across large teams

### Success Criteria
- Zero manual Weaver command execution required for standard workflows
- Sub-5-second impact on build times for unchanged schemas
- 100% adoption rate across eligible projects (containing Weaver YAML files)
- Successful integration with existing Nx build targets

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Software engineers working in Nx workspaces (1000+ engineers)
- **Secondary**: DevOps engineers managing build pipelines
- **Technologies**: Primarily Svelte and Node.js TypeScript projects

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

#### 1. Weaver Executable Management
- **Auto-download and installation** of Weaver executables per project
- **Version pinning** with manual upgrade path (no automatic version updates)
- **Per-project version specification** in project configuration
- **Support for multiple Weaver versions** across different projects in the monorepo
- **Executable caching** to avoid redundant downloads

#### 2. Project Detection and Configuration
- **Automatic project detection** based on presence of YAML files in configurable directory
- **Default directory**: `weaver/` (configurable)
- **Configuration hierarchy**:
  - Workspace-level defaults
  - Project-level overrides
  - Support for team-specific policies
- **Opt-out capability**: Projects can disable Weaver integration

#### 3. Nx Target Integration
- **Automatic target generation**:
  - `nx weaver-validate <project>` - Schema validation
  - `nx weaver-generate <project>` - Code generation
  - `nx weaver-docs <project>` - Documentation generation
  - `nx weaver-clean <project>` - Clean generated assets
- **Build dependency integration**: Code generation runs before build when schemas change
- **Nx computation caching integration** for all Weaver operations

#### 4. Code Generation and Asset Management
- **Automatic code generation** triggered by schema file changes
- **Generated file tracking** to manage outdated assets
- **Clean target** to remove all generated files
- **Conventional output locations** following Nx patterns
- **Generated file cleanup** when schemas are removed

#### 5. Type-Safe Configuration
- **TypeScript interfaces** for Weaver configuration files
- **Default argument configuration** with type safety
- **Compile-time validation** of schema references
- **IDE autocompletion** for Weaver commands and options

#### 6. Environment and Argument Management
- **Environment variable management** for Weaver operations
- **Configurable default arguments** per operation type
- **Project-specific environment overrides**

### Error Handling and Developer Experience

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Non-blocking failures**: Show warnings and continue build process
- **Clear error messages** with actionable guidance
- **Graceful degradation** when Weaver operations fail

#### Developer Experience Features
- **Transparent operation**: Developers work normally, code generation happens automatically
- **Minimal configuration required** for standard use cases
- **Clear feedback** on Weaver operation status and results

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

#### Plugin Structure
- **Nx Plugin Architecture**: Standard Nx plugin with generators and executors
- **Custom Executors**: Purpose-built executors for Weaver operations
- **Inferred Targets**: Automatic target creation and dependency management
- **Project Graph Integration**: Proper dependency tracking for cache invalidation

#### Performance Requirements
- **Caching Integration**: Full integration with Nx computation caching
- **Cache Keys**: Based on schema file hashes and Weaver version
- **Distributed Caching Support**: Compatible with Nx Cloud and remote caching
- **Build Time Impact**: <5 seconds for unchanged schemas

#### Compatibility
- **Nx Version**: Support current LTS and latest Nx versions
- **Node.js**: Support Node.js LTS versions
- **TypeScript**: Compatible with TypeScript 4.x and 5.x
- **Operating Systems**: Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Configuration Schema

#### Workspace Configuration
```typescript
interface WeaverWorkspaceConfig {
  defaultVersion?: string;
  defaultArgs?: WeaverArgs;
  defaultEnvironment?: Record<string, string>;
  schemaDirectory?: string; // default: "weaver/"
  outputDirectory?: string;
  enabledByDefault?: boolean; // default: true
}
```

#### Project Configuration
```typescript
interface WeaverProjectConfig {
  enabled?: boolean;
  version?: string;
  args?: WeaverArgs;
  environment?: Record<string, string>;
  schemaDirectory?: string;
  outputDirectory?: string;
}
```

#### Weaver Arguments Interface
```typescript
interface WeaverArgs {
  validate?: string[];
  generate?: string[];
  docs?: string[];
  [command: string]: string[] | undefined;
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)
- Basic plugin scaffolding and Nx integration
- Weaver executable management and downloading
- Project detection based on YAML files
- Basic target generation (validate, generate, clean)

### Phase 2: Build Integration (Weeks 4-5)
- Integration with Nx build targets
- Automatic code generation before builds
- Basic caching implementation
- Error handling and warning system

### Phase 3: Type Safety and DX (Weeks 6-7)
- TypeScript interfaces for configuration
- Compile-time schema validation
- IDE integration and autocompletion
- Enhanced error messages and developer feedback

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features (Weeks 8-9)
- Advanced caching with distributed support
- Configuration hierarchy and team policies
- Performance optimization
- Documentation and migration guides

### Phase 5: Polish and Release (Weeks 10-11)
- Comprehensive testing across different project types
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation completion
- Public release preparation

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Dependencies
- Nx framework and its plugin system
- OpenTelemetry Weaver executable availability
- TypeScript compiler integration
- Node.js file system APIs

### Constraints
- Must not break existing Nx workflows
- Cannot require changes to existing schema files
- Must work with existing Weaver versions
- Performance impact must be minimal for large monorepos

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- Number of projects automatically detected and configured
- Developer opt-out rate (target: <5%)
- Time to first successful code generation

### Performance Metrics
- Cache hit rate for Weaver operations (target: >80%)
- Build time impact measurement
- Memory usage during code generation

### Quality Metrics
- Number of schema validation errors caught at build time
- Developer satisfaction survey results
- Issue resolution time

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Weaver version compatibility**: Mitigated by per-project version pinning
- **Performance impact**: Mitigated by aggressive caching strategy
- **Cache invalidation complexity**: Addressed through proper dependency tracking

### Adoption Risks
- **Developer resistance to new tooling**: Mitigated by transparent, opt-out design
- **Configuration complexity**: Addressed through sensible defaults and minimal required config

### Operational Risks
- **Weaver executable availability**: Mitigated by local caching and error handling
- **Network dependencies**: Addressed through offline-first approach where possible

## Open Questions

1. Should the plugin support custom Weaver binary sources beyond official releases?
2. How should the plugin handle workspace-wide schema registries if needed in the future?
3. Should there be integration with popular IDE extensions for enhanced developer experience?
